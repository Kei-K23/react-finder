# React Finder üóÇÔ∏è

Recreating the interactive Mac OS file explore 'Finder' üóÇÔ∏è but this one is for web üï∏Ô∏è. I recreated most functionalities of Mac OS Finder, including UI and user interactions functionalities and features.

## Motivation

In recently, I really like the UI style call `glassmorphism`. I always wanted to created and use that UI system in my project but I have no chance to use that UI design for some reason. After that, I decided to create that effect in side project by combining with tree data structure. All these idea combining and inspiring from Mac OS UI design system, this `React Finder` project is rise.

## Features

- Beautiful UI design with `Glassmorphism` effect
- Similar behavior and functionalities of Mac OS Finder
- Create, rename and delete file and folder with native features like right click on item
- User's device battery status
- Settings to change background wallpaper
- Others...
