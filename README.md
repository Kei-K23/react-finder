# React Finder 🗂️

Recreating Mac OS file explore 'Finder' 🗂️ but this one is for web 🕸️. I recreated most functionalities of Mac OS Finder, including UI and user interactions functionalities and features.

⚠️ This is still in development ⚠️

## Motivation

In recently, I really like the UI style call `glassmorphism`. I always wanted to created and use that UI system in my project but I have no chance to use that UI design for some reason. After that, I decided to create that effect in side project by combining with tree data structure. All these idea combining and inspiring from Mac OS UI design system, this `React Finder` project is rise.
